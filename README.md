## **Technologies Used**
- **EJS**: Handles application logic and user interactions.
- **Node.js**: Serves as the backend runtime environment for building the server-side logic.
- **Neon PostgreSQL**: Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database used to store and manage application data.
- **CSS**: Styles and layouts for better user experience.
- **Sequelize**: An ORM tool used to interact with the PostgreSQL database in a structured and efficient way.
- **JavaScript**: Handles frontend interactivity and enhances client-side functionality.
- **Render**: Cloud platform used to deploy and host the web application.

## **Features Implemented**

### **Core Requirements:**
- **Express Project and PostgreSQL:** Must use these within the project.
- **Deploy:** Deployed using Neon for the database server and Render for the web app deployment.
- **Tables:** Uses three tables (Trainer, Type, Pokemon).
- **Create Views:** Many views created using ejs.
- **Login:** Users can login and register for their "Pokemon list dashboard".

### **Additional Features I Made:**
- **Trainer List:** Allows users to see a list of trainers on the app.
- **Singular Pokemon:** There is only one specific pokemon for each trainer, so no duplicates to where two trainers can have the same pokemon. (Might change this in the future.)
